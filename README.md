# The M-AILABS Speech Dataset

The M-AILABS Speech Dataset is the first large dataset that we are providing free-of-charge, freely usable as training data for speech recognitionand speech synthesis.
Most of the data is based on LibriVox and Project Gutenberg. The training data consist of nearly thousand hours of audio and the text-files in prepared format.
A transcription is provided for each clip. Clips vary in length from 1 to 20 seconds and have a total length of approximately shown in the list (and in the respective info.txt-files) below.
The texts were published between 1884 and 1964, and are in the public domain. The audio was recorded by the LibriVox project and is also in the public domain â€“ except for Ukrainian.
Ukrainian audio was kindly provided either by Nash Format or Gwara Media for machine learning purposes only (please check the data info.txtfiles for details).
